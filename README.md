# Intelligent-Color-Recognition-System-for-Image-Processing
The Intelligent Color Recognition System for Image Processing is a computer vision-based application designed to accurately detect and identify colors in any given image. This project utilizes image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze an image, extract its color information, and display the detected colors along with their names.

**Key Features:**

Automated Color Detection: Identifies and labels colors in an image based on RGB values.

User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to upload images and receive real-time color analysis.

Extensive Color Database: Matches detected colors with a predefined database for accurate identification.

Applications: Useful for design tools, accessibility solutions for color blindness, object recognition, and more.

This project is ideal for students and developers interested in data analytics, image processing, and AI-driven applications. Contributions and improvements are welcome! ðŸš€
